## Announcement

This GitHub account was created to comply with INTERSPEECH's double-blind regulations, and it will be relocated to a different address once the acceptance results are published.

## Introduction

we propose a signal decoupling-based approach. When employing a neural network for AEC tasks, the network implicitly learns the echo path from the input far-end reference signal and microphone signal to achieve echo elimination. Our proposed method decouples the energy component in the echo path from the input reference signal and microphone signal, allowing for separate predictions. We denote this energy component as the energy scaling factor $alpha$. The original far-end signal is replaced by the product of multiplying the far-end reference signal with the energy scaling factor, and this product, along with the microphone signal, is used as input to the echo cancellation network. \autoref{fig:alpha_effiency} depicts a comparison between the unprocessed signal (mix) and the outcomes obtained by employing the traditional adaptive filtering method frequency domain Kalman filter (FDKF), as well as the reference signal multiplied by the energy scaling factor $alpha$ and subsequently processed through FDKF. The variants incorporating $alpha$ showcased in the figure demonstrate further enhancement in the performance of FDKF, thereby initially validating the necessity and feasibility of our proposed method. Additionally, this observation supports our utilization of signal decoupling in deep learning methods.
